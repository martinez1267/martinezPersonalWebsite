    <section class="about-content">
      <p>I am a Computing &amp; Informatics student at Rowan University (DevOps &amp; Cybersecurity). I focus on reliable systems, maintainable code, and learning through real projects. I’ve built and tuned servers, migrated OSes, debugged gnarly issues, and delivered for clients on unusual hardware.</p>
      <p>Languages: JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, PHP, Swift. Skills: Linux sysadmin, networking, firewalls, CI/CD, Docker, server hosting &amp; backups, debugging. I value persistence, integrity, and clear thinking under pressure.</p>

        <strong>Project: Central Command Center</strong>
    </br>
        <p>I built a multi-node Linux cluster from consumer hardware, migrating each machine from Windows to Debian-based Linux.  
    I configured one machine as a Wi-Fi gateway, connected the rest via Ethernet, and hosted a modded Minecraft server.  
    With limited resources (~11 GB RAM), I optimized JVM settings and tuned the server for performance.  
    This taught me practical networking, Linux administration, and system optimization under constraints.  </p>

        <strong>Project: Mobile Modified Entertainment</strong>
        </br>
        <p>
    For a client, I successfully transferred and configured modded game files onto a Steam Deck.  
    I troubleshot USB cable limitations, explored Linux desktop mode, and used Wi-Fi file transfers with command line tools.  
    I also installed compatibility software to ensure smooth execution of the game in the SteamOS environment.  
    This project strengthened my ability to adapt, experiment, and deliver solutions on unusual hardware.

<strong>Advanced Intentional Manufacturing</strong>
<br>
<p>
Acquired and heavily modified multiple 3D printers to improve reliability, 
print quality, and speed, including hardware upgrades and firmware customization. 
Designed original 3D models using CAD/modeling software and produced functional prototypes 
as well as consumer products. Handled full printer maintenance cycles from troubleshooting 
mechanical/electrical issues to calibrating and fine-tuning print settings. Extended the work into 
an entrepreneurial effort by producing and selling custom prints, gaining experience in product design, 
quality assurance, and customer fulfillment. This project 
strengthened my skills in hardware optimization, digital modeling, iterative 
prototyping, and small-scale production management.
