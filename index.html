  <p id="main-paragraph">
    I am a Computing & Informatics student at Rowan University with a concentration in DevOps and Cybersecurity.  
    My focus is on creating reliable systems, writing maintainable code, and learning through real-world projects.  
    I have experience with multiple programming languages, Linux systems administration, and client-facing problem solving.  
  </p>

  <p id="project-one">
    <strong>Project: Central Command Center</strong><br>
    I built a multi-node Linux cluster from consumer hardware, migrating each machine from Windows to Debian-based Linux.  
    I configured one machine as a Wi-Fi gateway, connected the rest via Ethernet, and hosted a modded Minecraft server.  
    With limited resources (~11 GB RAM), I optimized JVM settings and tuned the server for performance.  
    This taught me practical networking, Linux administration, and system optimization under constraints.  
  </p>

  <p id="project-two">
    <strong>Project: Mobile Modified Gaming</strong><br>
    For a client, I successfully transferred and configured modded game files onto a Steam Deck.  
    I troubleshot USB cable limitations, explored Linux desktop mode, and used Wi-Fi file transfers with command line tools.  
    I also installed compatibility software to ensure smooth execution of the game in the SteamOS environment.  
    This project strengthened my ability to adapt, experiment, and deliver solutions on unusual hardware.

    <p id="project-one">One of my personal projects was based on creating a communicating computer cluster in my home,
        learning how to switch computers from a windows operating system to a debian based linux operating system.
        During this project, I learned how computers talk to each other and how to connect
        them via ethernet cable and wifi to make them talk to each other.
        I created a computer cluster in order to make a modded gaming server. I hosted this gaming server on one
        computer
        and had it recieving wifi from another computer. I learned through intense trial and error, as it took me days
        and weeks to get it to work. I also had to configure the server to be able to fit on the given computer.
        I was working with very limited resources, so I had to make the server work with 11 GB of RAM.

    <p id="project-two">Another project I completed for a client was to put a modded game onto a steam deck. Figuring
        this out was difficult
        as the steam deck is an odd device to navigate desktop mode with. I had to download modded game files from my
        computer
        to the steam deck through linux commands and through trial and error.
        I first tried using linux commands to transfer files through cable, however, the cable did not allow
        the steam deck device to be connected. Eventually, I found out that I could download the modded game files
        through
        wifi through linux commands in order for the game to join the specific server I made.
        I also had to download a specific software onto the device in order for the game to be compatible with the steam
        deck device.
