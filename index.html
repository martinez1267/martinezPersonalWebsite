    <p id="project-one">One of my personal projects was based on creating a communicating computer cluster in my home,
        learning how to switch computers from a windows operating system to a debian based linux operating system.
        During this project, I learned how computers talk to each other and how to connect
        them via ethernet cable and wifi to make them talk to each other.
        I created a computer cluster in order to make a modded gaming server. I hosted this gaming server on one
        computer
        and had it recieving wifi from another computer. I learned through intense trial and error, as it took me days
        and weeks to get it to work. I also had to configure the server to be able to fit on the given computer.
        I was working with very limited resources, so I had to make the server work with 11 GB of RAM.
    </p>

    <p id="project-two">Another project I completed for a client was to put a modded game onto a steam deck. Figuring
        this out was difficult
        as the steam deck is an odd device to navigate desktop mode with. I had to download modded game files from my
        computer
        to the steam deck through linux commands and through trial and error.
        I first tried using linux commands to transfer files through cable, however, the cable did not allow
        the steam deck device to be connected. Eventually, I found out that I could download the modded game files
        through
        wifi through linux commands in order for the game to join the specific server I made.
        I also had to download a specific software onto the device in order for the game to be compatible with the steam
        deck device.
